Code can be imported into joern in two ways. The program `joern-parse`
can be used to create Code Property Graphs and persist them in a
format based on Google Protocol Buffer messages, or, `create-cpg` can
be used to instruct joern-server to create a code property graph and
make it available via the REST API.

## Creating Code Property Graphs with `joern-parse`

Code property graphs can be created from C/C++ code using
`joern-parse`. For example, to create a Code Property Graph for the
vulnerable sample program `tarpit-c`, you can issue the following
commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/tarpit-c
./joern-parse tarpit-c
```

This will create a file named `cpg.bin.zip` in the current working
directory from the C/C++ code in the directory `tarpit-c`.

Joern-parse has the following signature:

```bash
./joern-parse <path/to/directory> --out <path/to/cpg/cpg_name>
```

It requires an input directory to be specified as a first positional
argument. Optionally, it allows the output location to be specified
via the `--out` flag.

```bash
./joern-parse tarpit-c --out tarpitc.bin.zip
```

will write the CPG to `tarpitc.bin.zip`.

If you omit the ```--out``` flag, the CPG is named `cpg.bin.zip` and
stored in the current working directory.

To view all options offered by `fuzzyc2cpg`, simply run
```bash
./joern-parse
```

## Creating Code Property Graphs with `cpg-create`

Make sure that `joern-server` is installed in `$JOERN-SERVER-DIR` and
that `cpgclientlib` is installed. Next, ensure that the joern server
is running. If it is not, you can start it as follows:

```bash
cd $JOERN-SERVER-DIR
./joernd
```

In another terminal, issue the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/tarpit-c
cpg-create tarpit-c
```

This will parse the code in the directory `tarpit-c`, create a code
property graph on, and make it available via the joern server.
