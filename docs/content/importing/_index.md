Code can be imported into joern in two ways. The program `joern-parse`
can be used to create Code Property Graphs and persist them in a
format based on Google Protocol Buffer messages, or, `create-cpg` can
be used to instruct joern-server to create a code property graph and
make it available via the REST API.

## Creating Code Property Graphs with `joern-parse`

Code property graphs can be created from C/C++ code using
`joern-parse`. For example, to create a Code Property Graph for the
vulnerable sample program `tarpit-c`, you can issue the following
commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/tarpit-c
./joern-parse tarpit-c
```

This will create a file named `cpg.bin` in the current working
directory from the C/C++ code in the directory `tarpit-c`.

Joern-parse has the following signature:

```bash
./joern-parse <path/to/directory> --out <path/to/cpg/cpg_name>
```

It requires an input directory to be specified as a first positional
argument. Optionally, it allows the output location to be specified
via the `--out` flag.

```bash
./joern-parse tarpit-c --out tarpitc.bin.zip
```

will write the CPG to `tarpitc.bin.zip`.

If you omit the ```--out``` flag, the CPG is named `cpg.bin` and
stored in the current working directory.

To view all options offered by `fuzzyc2cpg`, simply run
```bash
./joern-parse
```

## Dealing with Header Files and Macros
What happens with header files included in your programs? By default,
unless you explicitly copy their contents into the source files that
reference them, `joern-parse` assumes that they are not available. The
resulting CPG is valid but possibly imprecise.

In the fortunate situation where some or even all of the header files
and macro definitions are available, `joern-parse` allows this
information to be incorporated into CPG generation using the built-in
[fuzzy C/C++
preprocessor](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/fuzzyc2cpg/#running). In
line with the approach followed by the fuzzy C/C++ parser, any missing
header files will simply be elided in the generation of the CPG.

For a more detailed explanation of the preprocessor options available
to you, pass the `--help` option to `joern-parse`.

## Creating Code Property Graphs with `cpg-create`

Make sure that `joern-server` is installed in `$JOERN-SERVER-DIR` and
that `cpgclientlib` is installed. Next, ensure that the joern server
is running. If it is not, you can start it as follows:

```bash
cd $JOERN-SERVER-DIR
./joernd
```

In another terminal, issue the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/tarpit-c
cpg-create tarpit-c
```

This will parse the code in the directory `tarpit-c`, create a code
property graph on, and make it available via the joern server.

Note that the directory passed to `cpg-create` **must** be relative to 
the server's current working directory. For example, with the following setup:
- `~/joern-server` - server working directory
- `~/repos/my-code` - code location

We would run `cpg-create`, specifying the location of `my-code` relative to the
server working directory. This would be:

```bash
 cpg-create ../repos/my-code
```

## Creating Code Property Graphs with self-built fuzzyc2cpg

When using the [fuzzyc2cpg](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/fuzzyc2cpg) language
frontend directly (instead of running `joern-parse`), the cpg file
that is created does not include enhancements. These enhancements are
needed to find external methods, not declared in the input source code
for example. When using `joern-parse` these enhancements are written
into the created cpg file.


One can trigger the enhancement step manually by doing the following in the REPL:

```bash
import io.shiftleft.joern.Cpg2Scpg
import io.shiftleft.joern.CpgLoader
Cpg2Scpg.run("cpg.bin", true, CpgLoader.defaultSemanticsFile)
loadCpg("cpg.bin")
```

Beware: This is not the intended way to do things! Normally you should
be alright using `joern-parse`.
